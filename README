This is a ray marching shader I built from scratch. I generate camera rays for each pixel on the screen and march them using an SDF. 
I then approximate the normal vector using the gradient of the SDF and use that as the ambient and diffuse color, using a white light 
as the specular color. After calculating these three components, I then calculate the phong shading of the pixel by combing the ambient 
color with the diffuse and specular color for each light source in the scene. I have a range of different models you can explore including
a shifting mandelbulb. I have also implemented a First person camera, allowing you to move around and explore the models. I made sure to
include strafing and smooth movement by calculating a deltaTime using glut.
